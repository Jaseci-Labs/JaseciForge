# Jaseci Forge VS Code Extension - Developer Guide

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the extension (commands, providers, activation, etc.)
- `resources/` - Icons and static assets
- `out/` - Compiled output (auto-generated)
- `package.json` - Extension manifest (commands, views, activation events, etc.)
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation
- `DEVELOPER.md` - (This file) Developer/contributor documentation

## Getting Started
