# Jaseci Forge Architecture

Jaseci Forge is built on a layered architecture that promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture.

## Core Layers

### 1. Data Layer
The data layer is responsible for managing application state and data models. It includes:
- Redux store configuration
- Data models and interfaces
- State slices and reducers
- Selectors for data access

### 2. Service Layer
The service layer handles external communication and business logic:
- API clients and services
- Data transformation
- Business logic implementation
- Error handling

### 3. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer manages the user interface and user interactions:
- React components following atomic design
- Page templates
- Custom hooks for data access
- UI state management

### 4. Core Infrastructure
The core infrastructure provides essential functionality:
- Authentication and authorization
- Routing configuration
- Error boundaries
- Global state management
- Utility functions

## Feature Modules

Each feature in Jaseci Forge is organized as a module that contains:
- Feature-specific components
- Services
- Actions
- Custom hooks
- Tests
- Documentation

## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each layer has a specific responsibility
   - Clear boundaries between layers
   - Independent development and testing

2. **Atomic Design**
   - Components organized by complexity
   - Reusable building blocks
   - Consistent design patterns

3. **State Management**
   - Centralized state with Redux
   - Local state for UI components
   - Predictable state updates

4. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript throughout the application
   - Strong type definitions
   - Compile-time error checking

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Component testing
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end testing

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-first organization
   - Clear file naming conventions
   - Consistent directory structure

2. **State Management**
   - Use Redux for global state
   - Local state for UI components
   - Custom hooks for data access

3. **Component Design**
   - Follow atomic design principles
   - Keep components focused and small
   - Use composition over inheritance

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error boundaries
   - Proper error logging
   - User-friendly error messages

5. **Performance**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Memoization where appropriate

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature module
   - Implement data models
   - Add services and actions
   - Build UI components
   - Write tests

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Component tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Code documentation
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Architecture documentation

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and performant applications with Jaseci Forge.
