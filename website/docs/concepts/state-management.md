# State Management

State management refers to how application data (state) is stored, updated, and shared across components. Jaseci Forge may use tools like Redux, Zustand, or React Context for managing state.

## Purpose
- Keep UI in sync with data.
- Share data between components.
- Enable predictable updates and debugging.

## Example (Redux)
```js
// store.js
import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: { increment: (state) => state + 1 },
});
export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
export const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer });
```

State management helps build scalable, maintainable apps.
