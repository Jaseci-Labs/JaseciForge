# Theming

Theming allows you to customize the look and feel of your application, such as colors, fonts, and spacing. Jaseci Forge supports theming to enable brand consistency and user preferences (like dark mode).

## Purpose
- Provide a consistent visual identity.
- Support user preferences (e.g., dark/light mode).
- Enable easy customization and branding.

## Example
```js
// Example: toggling dark mode
function ThemeToggle({ toggleTheme }) {
  return <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>;
}
```

Theming helps create a flexible and accessible user experience.
